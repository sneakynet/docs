# Nortel Business Communications Manager 50

The Nortel BCM50 is a small office telephone system.  Commonly
referred to as a Private Branch Exchange, the BCM50 has more features
in common with an advanced key system than a true PBX, but still packs
a significant number of features.

The BCM50 is capable of driving both digital and analog telephones,
can make use of IP telephony via the UNISTIM protocol, and supports
both IP and physical outbound trunks.  The SneakyNet BCM is connected
to the main TDM network via a Digital Trunk Module which provides a
PRI interface on the BCM.  This allows for 23 simulataneous phone
calls to the public network, while other phone calls internal to the
office network can occur independently.
