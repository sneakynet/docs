# Office

Its difficult to be a business without some office infrastructure.  To
this end SneakyNet has an office telephone system for taking orders
and processing support inquiries, as well as an office IP network to
be able to use the latest in technology from Microsoft and other
vendors to provide for customer needs and effect swift and correct
billing for services consumed.

The office equipment isn't rated for quite the same harsh conditions
as the equipment that would run in a telephone company's facilities,
and its visibly quite different.  The equipment is made of more
plastic, has more lights, indicators, and is clearly meant to be
physically interacted with more frequently.  Usually its considered
acceptable if this equipment is down during a disaster, as the people
responsible for resolving the emergency will relocate to the Central
Office facility to coordinate from there.

The office equipment is contained in a smaller portable rack which
packs up into a nylon case.  With some effort its possible to shoulder
this case and walk with it.
