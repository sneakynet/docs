# Telco

Telephone Company, or 'Telco' equipment, is the portion of the network
that would be present at a Telephone Company Central Office (CO) where
it could be directly interconnected into both packet and circuit
switched networks to provide service onwards to customers.

Equipment that is destined to go to a telco facility is easily
identifiable because of its form factor and harsh operating condition
ratings.  Equipment will usually possess multiple power supplies,
provide an option for directly consuming -48v power, and be capable of
operating for extended periods of time at high temperature.

With packet voice being the norm today it is easy to forget that
telephone service used to be considered the single most reliable
service money could buy, but there was a time where you could have
power out, no water, and questionable gas service.  Through all this
though you could be confident that your phone would ring and you could
call your loved ones and emergency services to deal with any situation
that arose.

The majority of SneakyNet's hardware is contained in a rolling 19"
equipment rack making it easy to transport and store.  The connections
to the outside world are made via a high current AC power inlet jack
and a series of patch panels on the front face.
