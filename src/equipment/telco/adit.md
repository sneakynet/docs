# Carrier Access Corperation Adit 600

The TDM network normally passes around data in bundles on T1 carriers.
This is a channelized medium, and is capable of carrying a very dense
bundle of calls over a single cable.  To make individual numbers
available, they need to be broken out on individual lines for
equipment to be plugged into.  A channel bank performs this function
by taking a bank of Bearer or "B" channels from a T1 and turning them
into individual telephone circuits.

The CAC Adit 600 is a telco channel bank.  These units were commonly
found in roadside equipment cabinets serving subscriber lines where
distance or density outstripped the existing copper plant in the area.
Designed to consume 2 T1 lines and provide a mix of phone and data
service, these extremely ruggedized devices are commonly found in
places where space is tight and conditions are harsh.
