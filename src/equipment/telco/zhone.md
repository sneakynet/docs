# Zhone Z-Plex-10-24S

The TDM network normally passes around data in bundles on T1 carriers.
This is a channelized medium, and is capable of carrying a very dense
bundle of calls over a single cable.  To make individual numbers
available, they need to be broken out on individual lines for
equipment to be plugged into.  A channel bank performs this function
by taking a bank of Bearer or "B" channels from a T1 and turning them
into individual telephone circuits.

The Zhone Z-Plex-10-24S is a compound device in a 1RU form factor
designed to consume 1-2 T1 circuits and provide a mix of FXS
interfaces, v.35 data, and redundancy across lines.  The single power
supply present allows it to operate economically in an office setting,
however it is capable of drawing from a secondary -48v supply.

The Zhone company continues to exist as the modern brand "DZS" who
continues to manufacture telecom equipment.
