# Patton Electronics Dialfire 2960

The spectacularly named Dialfire 2960 is a Remote Access Server.  This
is a special class of device that includes all the components for
dial-in networking into one RU of space.  The device has dual power
supplies, and models exist which are capable of terminating 96
concurrent calls.  The SneakyNet unit only has sufficient Digital
Signal Processing capacity (DSP) to support 23 concurrent calls.  It
connects via a T1 Primary Rate Interface (PRI) to the TDM network, and
connects via 10/100 Fast Ethernet to the IP network.

The Dialfire handles all the machinery of dynamically connecting an
inbound phone call to a modem, negotiating with it to begin a data
channel, figuring out what the caller wants and performing sufficient
authentication to grant those services.  The Dialfire authenticates
users using the 802.1X protocol suite, specifically the Remote Access
Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol.

Surprisingly, the Dialfire is still a production device and Patton
Electronics, a Maryland telecom company can still supply spare parts
and new components.
