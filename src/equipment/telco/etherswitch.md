# HP Switch

![Ethernet Switch](/img/etherswitch.png)

The telephone company end of the line has some IP network
requirements, mostly just switched ethernet.  This is provided by a
managed HP/Aruba ethernet switch.  The switch maintains a 200M/s LACP
bond to the ISR, and provides VLAN bundling and unbundling to connect
to internal devices, and to the broader internet.
