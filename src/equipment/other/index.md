There's some equipment that supports the SneakyNet operation that
doesn't fit in any category, because its either anachronistic or just
something that needs to exist to make things work at an event that
doesn't technically belong.  Items in this category include various
modern hardware like current generation laptops, cables being abused
for things they weren't designed for, and "crutch" hardware such as
LTE modems and WiFi to Ethernet bridges.

This equipment is modern, its stuff you should generally recognize and
can be sourced from any reputable component supplier.  Most of
SneakyNet's hardware came from Amazon or Microcenter and gets stored
away in plastic bins when not in use.  For modern hardware like this
its always important to check what kind of batteries are in use, so we
carefully store ours under climate controlled conditions and check the
battery condition monthly.
