# Equipment

The SneakyNet services are provided via a myriad of differnet
hardware.  Some of this hardware is modern, some of it is not.  The
entire stack is based on hardware that could have been found at a
datacenter operated by a small regional Internet service provider
(ISP) at the turn of the millenium.

See the additional pages for information on each specific component of
our network.
