# Why Is SneakyNet

Why not?

## No really, why?

This is all for fun.  Networks are a fantastically interesting form of
communication over often times vast differences.  These distances are
shortened from days and weeks of travel to mere milliseconds by
colossal infrastructure systems that relay, process, and transmit data
from point to point.

As time moves forward and technology changes, some forms of network
communication become obsolete.  SneakyNet attempts to preserve some of
the fun of the early days of the internet where network technology was
new and exciting, and the concept of connecting your communications
instrument to a larger collection was a novel experience.

We hope that our mission is fulfilled and you have gained some new
understanding of how the connected world around you started, as well
as getting to see a neat technology in action.

## What about it is sneaky?

We have to be sneaky so the phone company people from
[ShadyTel](https://shady.tel) don't notice what we're up to and start
billing for the telephone lines.  How else could we offer our low low
prices?
